We believe that the human world has not adjusted to the connectivity it had thrust upon it by the information age. Now we are struggling with the negative network effects including monopolization, filter-bubbles and censorship. The good stuff is working its way down slowly - having been predicted by Doug Englebart over 50 years ago. He called this aim [Augmenting the Collective IQ](http://dougengelbart.org/content/view/172/130/). Organizations already strain to digest the deluge of noisy signals and adversarial actions. At the same time our most powerful networks have no intention of reaching for lofty human goals - they are held captive by ad-supported business models.

This is where the promise of blockchain and distributed systems may leave a mark. Any system composed of humans will inherit our complex, non-equilibrium possibilities. By developing an experimental framework informed by the patterns that have already found stable employment in nature we hope to unlock a new engineering space for systems that accenuate the positive aspects of our hyperconnected humanity.
