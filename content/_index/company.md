Starling Foundries LLC is a systems and software engineering firm founded in to operate at the leading edge of an emerging new cooperation pattern inspired by those found in nature but currently underrepresented in the patterns applied to human networks. In the world distributed crypto networks a new commoning pattern enabled by distributed ledgers has been developing for years and we believe it is now mature enough to begin experimentation.

In service of this aim our firm has developed considerable expertise and partnerships in the emerging network coordination patterns such as blockchain smart contract platforms and peer to peer networks.
